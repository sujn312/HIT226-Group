    <h1> Language and culture </h1>
    <p>An Indigenous Australian is someone of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in the community in which he/she lives or has lived.</p>
    <h2>Formal language terms</h2>
    <p>The term aboriginal, written with a small ‘a’ is used to describe indigenous people around the world and fails to recognise the uniqueness of Indigenous Australians.</p>
    <p>The term Aboriginal, with a capital ‘A’, on the other hand denotes Indigenous Australians and is therefore a more appropriate word to use.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Indigenous Australians are not, however, a homogeneous group and prefer to be called by the language or cultural groups to which they belong. For example, in the Northern Territory there are many different groups such as the Larrakia (Darwin), Tiwi people who live on Bathurst and Melville Islands, the Yolngu from Arnhem Land and the Warlpiri from areas north and west of Alice Springs.</p>

  <h1> Language background</h1>
  <p>AIt is important too to avoid ethnic or racist labels which create negative stereotypes. Any person, who was born in Australia or has acquired Australian citizenship regardless of their cultural background or origins, should be referred to as Australian.</p>
  <p>Terms such as ‘wog’ or ‘dago’ or ‘chink’ should be avoided as they demean and belittle people and are seen as a form of racial harassment.</p>

  <p>It is important that people with a disability feel that they are part of university life and are not excluded through the inappropriate use of language. Language that constructs people with disabilities as victims and focuses on the disability and not the person is inappropriate. It is therefore important to put the person, not the disability first.</p>

<div class="modal-content">
  <span class="close" id="close6">&times;</span>
  <p>Sentences can be short and concise, or longer and more complex. However, it is important to vary the length of your sentences so that your writing doesn't sound too abrupt (with the overuse of short sentences), or too densely packed with ideas (with the overuse of long sentences).</p>
  <p>One of the most common problems in writing is students writing sentence fragments rather than complete sentences.</p>
  <p>What is a sentence?</p>
  <p>A complete sentence (which is also called an independent clause) must always contain a subject and a verb. For example:</p>
  <div class="table">

  <h2>Parallel structure</h2>
  <p>The term means using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas have the same level of importance. Additionally, in order to ensure the writing in a grammatical structure is by using all nouns (or noun phrases) or verb + noun (or noun phrase). For example:</p>

      <li>This sentence finishes with a full stop.</li>
      <li>This sentence does not!</li>

    <h4>Commas</h4>
    <p><strong>Rules</strong></p>

      <li>Use a comma to separate the elements in a list.</li>
      <li>Use a comma + a conjunction (and, but, for, nor, yet, or, so) <strong>to connect two independent clauses.</strong></li>

      <li><strong>A summary</strong></li>
      <li><strong>A quote</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Apostrophes</h4>

      <h2>Acknowledging sources in text</h2>
      <p>References are given in your text by including the surname of the author and the date that the idea was first published. If it is a direct quote, you should also include the page number.</p>
      <h3>Look at the examples below</h3>
      <div class="table">
        <table>
        <tr>
          <td>1.  In examining Gandhi's search for Absolute Truth and post-modern perspectives, Salla (1996, p.43) concludes that there can be no non-violent future, only a non-violent present.</td>
          <td>2.  Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence was essentially a philosophy of action, a means of resolving conflict and creating a just society free of violence. "By non-violence Gandhi means … the technique of conducting social relations characterised by constructive peaceful attitudes …" (Bondurant 1988, p.193). For Gandhi, this meant living a life of 'truth'.</td>
          <td>3.  "The distinctions [between individual and collective violence] are helpful in so far as they make violence against women visible and connect different forms of violence to structures of domination" (Tolhurst 1997, p.10).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p>You will have noticed that there are two ways of writing the reference in-text. Either you can write it at the end of the quote, paraphrase or summary or you can write the author’s surname as part of the sentence.</p>
